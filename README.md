# CreateRL
#### Classic Reinforcement Learning algorithms

The goal of this project is to implement model-free RL algorithms.
There already exists a wealth of different implementations of these algorithms. However, it isn't easy to see the sometimes nuanced differences in code- and algorithmic design when comparing different code-bases.
Thus, these implementations are easy to understand and hopefully more effortless for you to compare.
